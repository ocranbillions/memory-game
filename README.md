# Memory Game Project

Hi everyone, this is a memory game I built as part of my Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Program. 


## How To Play
The goal of this game is to match all pairs that are of identical faces.

### Instructions
>- You have two clicks per move
>- Click on a card to unveil to symbol
>- Click a second card to unveil its symbol
>- If the two are the same symbol, both cards stay open.
>- There are a total of 8 pairs on the grid
>- Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you've matched all the pairs
>- The game is completed when pairs are matched.

At the end of the game a window appears with details on the number of moves made, time spent your star rating.
Have fun playing it.
